 Apache HTTP Server 2.4 Limited OpenSSL Distribution

 This binary installation of OpenSSL is a limited distribution of the
 files derived from the OpenSSL project:

   LICENSE.txt (includes openssl LICENSE)
   OPENSSL-NEWS.txt
   OPENSSL-README.txt
   conf\openssl.cnf
   bin\libeay32.dll
   bin\ssleay32.dll
   bin\openssl.exe

 These are the minimal libraries and tools required to use mod_ssl as 
 distributed with Apache HTTP Server version 2.4.  No library link files, 
 headers or sources are distributed with this binary distribution.  Please 
 refer to the <http://www.openssl.org/> site for complete source or binary 
 distributions.

 These OpenSSL binaries were built for distribution from the U.S. without 
 support for the patented encryption methods IDEA, MDC-2 or RC5.

 The Apache HTTP Project only supports the binary distribution of these files
 and development of the mod_ssl module.  We cannot provide support assistance
 for using or configuring the OpenSSL package or these modules.  Please refer
 all installation and configuration questions to the appropriate forum,
 such as the user supported lists, <http://httpd.apache.org/userslist.html> 
 the Apache HTTP Server user's list or <http://www.openssl.org/support/> the
 OpenSSL support page.

 All rights reserved.

 DESCRIPTION
 -----------

 The OpenSSL Project is a collaborative effort to develop a robust,
 commercial-grade, fully featured, and Open Source toolkit implementing the
 Secure Sockets Layer (SSLv3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols as
 well as a full-strength general purpose cryptograpic library. The project is
 managed by a worldwide community of volunteers that use the Internet to
 communicate, plan, and develop the OpenSSL toolkit and its related
 documentation.

 OpenSSL is descended from the SSLeay library developed by Eric A. Young
 and Tim J. Hudson.  The OpenSSL toolkit is licensed under a dual-license (the
 OpenSSL license plus the SSLeay license), which means that you are free to
 get and use it for commercial and non-commercial purposes as long as you
 fulfill the conditions of both licenses.

 OVERVIEW
 --------

 The OpenSSL toolkit includes:

 libssl.a:
     Provides the client and server-side implementations for SSLv3 and TLS.

 libcrypto.a:
     Provides general cryptographic and X.509 support needed by SSL/TLS but
     not logically part of it.

 openssl:
     A command line tool that can be used for:
        Creation of key parameters
        Creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs
        Calculation of message digests
        Encryption and decryption
        SSL/TLS client and server tests
        Handling of S/MIME signed or encrypted mail
        And more...

 INSTALLATION
 ------------

 See the appropriate file:
        INSTALL         Linux, Unix, etc.
        INSTALL.DJGPP   DOS platform with DJGPP
        INSTALL.NW      Netware
        INSTALL.OS2     OS/2
        INSTALL.VMS     VMS
        INSTALL.W32     Windows (32bit)
        INSTALL.W64     Windows (64bit)
        INSTALL.WCE     Windows CE

 SUPPORT
 -------

 See the OpenSSL website www.openssl.org for details on how to obtain
 commercial technical support.

 If you have any problems with OpenSSL then please take the following steps
 first:

    - Download the current snapshot from ftp://ftp.openssl.org/snapshot/
      to see if the problem has already been addressed
    - Remove ASM versions of libraries
    - Remove compiler optimisation flags

 If you wish to report a bug then please include the following information in
 any bug report:

    - On Unix systems:
        Self-test report generated by 'make report'
    - On other systems:
        OpenSSL version: output of 'openssl version -a'
        OS Name, Version, Hardware platform
        Compiler Details (name, version)
    - Application Details (name, version)
    - Problem Description (steps that will reproduce the problem, if known)
    - Stack Traceback (if the application dumps core)

 Email the report to:

    rt@openssl.org

 In order to avoid spam, this is a moderated mailing list, and it might
 take a day for the ticket to show up.  (We also scan posts to make sure
 that security disclosures aren't publically posted by mistake.) Mail
 to this address is recorded in the public RT (request tracker) database
 (see https://www.openssl.org/community/index.html#bugs for details) and
 also forwarded the public openssl-dev mailing list.  Confidential mail
 may be sent to openssl-security@openssl.org (PGP key available from the
 key servers).

 Please do NOT use this for general assistance or support queries.
 Just because something doesn't work the way you expect does not mean it
 is necessarily a bug in OpenSSL.

 You can also make GitHub pull requests. If you do this, please also send
 mail to rt@openssl.org with a link to the PR so that we can more easily
 keep track of it.

 LEGALITIES
 ----------

 A number of nations, in particular the U.S., restrict the use or export
 of cryptography. If you are potentially subject to such restrictions
 you should seek competent professional legal advice before attempting to
 develop or distribute cryptographic code.
